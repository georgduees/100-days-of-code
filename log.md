# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 20, 2020 )

**Today's Progress**: Created initial project to start with: Days of Code Helper
A tool which helps you write logfiles and parse these on the cli leve.
That way i hope to be more commited and have an easier way to log my daily progress.

**Thoughts:** Initial motivation is there, and fun to build many many things, the last times it failed, due to 'too much funs tuff to do' and not stick to a simple and reliable plan. Hopefully due to my collected 'drafts' i am able to complete and tick of many of these drafts as DaysOfCode projects.
